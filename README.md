My data analysis portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio
I am a data analyst from Zimbabwe. 
I have a banking background, and my passion for  data began when I joined X (formerly Twitter) back in 2022 since then I continued to develop my knowledge in data analysis. My biggest achievement to date has been the projects that I have worked including those in my portfolio.
